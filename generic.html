								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p> There are many different sources of generating energy in the United States. Most of the popular ones are coal, solar and wind energy.
								But there are many more such as wood, nuclear, petroleum, and geothermal. All of that data is availabe online so after some pre-processing 
								you can see how much a specific energy source was generated throughout the years 1990 to 2019. The data is available in many different formats.
								Some of the notable features are: 
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<ul>
										<li><b>Line Graphs:</b> The initial line graphs show you the amount of generated energy for each of the 
											energy sources from 1990 to 2019. 
											Along with that, you're able to see what percentage each energy source occupied for a specific year.
											If you'd like to only see specific energy sources, the checkboxes on the side assist with that.
											<span><img src="images/linegraphs.png" alt="blar" width="850" height="600"/></span>
										</li>
										<li><b>Bar Graphs:</b> The bar graphs have a similar functionality like the line graphs but they are obivously 
											represented different from a visual perspective. On the top, you will see a stacked bar chart with the total energy used for each source in MWh. On the bottom,
											you can see what percentage each source took overall in a specific year from 1990 - 2019. 
											<span><img src="images/bargraphs.png" alt="blar" width="850" height="600"/></span>
									</li>
										<li><b>Tables:</b> Through these tables, you will be able to go through all of the numbers for each state. And
											similar to the features in the line graphs, if you would like to compare different energy source numbers and percentages 
											throughout the year, just select the specific ones from the check box on the side!
											<span><img src="images/tables.png" alt="blar" width="850" height="600"/></span>
										</li>
										<li><b>Comparision between States:</b> There are a lot of charts in this section but it allows
											you to to compare the data between the states! And if you would like to see the exact number for 
											a State, Energy Source, and Year, select them from the menu for the speciifc zone and it will show!
											<span><img src="images/zones.png" alt="blar" width="850" height="600"/></span>
										</li>
										<li><b>Maps: </b> Finally in the last section, you are able to again manipulate two different zones.
											In each of the zones you are able to select a specific energy source and year. Once that is done, you
											can see the production of that energy source on the left-most map. The second map shows you 
											the percentages for the speciifc combination of energy and year you desire.

										</li>
									</ul>

								 <h3>Information about Data</h3>
								<p>The csv file that was used can be found <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/424/annual_generation_state.csv"> here </a></p>
								<p>There were multiple manipulations done to the file so that the specified data can be shown. For the pre-processing
									I had to initally convert the Energy Generated numbers from strings to numbers. Then, there were a couple 
									missing identifiers which had to be found and then removed. After that, I made sure to convert a couple 
									of the columns to categorical vallues. This helps in the graphing as every single one of them can be grouped
									together. I erased any of the Energy Generated numbers that were negative, deleted some of the smaller energy sources 
									and renamed the energy sources to be a bit more compact. </p>
								<h3>Interesting Data Found</h3>
								<p>I've found a couple things that may be of interest and worth researching a bit more. 
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<ul>
											<li>Usage of Geothermal energy has been very low in the past 3 decades. Only a few
												States adopted it 1990 and since then only few have been added since then. 
												One interesting thing to note is that all of the states are in the west coast.
												What may be the reason for that?
											</li>
											<li>Another thing to note is that almost a 100% of Kentucky's energy generation
												comes from coal! That comes as a surprise since different states adjusted
												as time passed on and some even had other energy sources being used more than coal.
												But Kentucky seems to be dead set on that. 
											</li>
											<li>In contrast to Kentucky, if we look at California's energy usage it is basically no coal! 
												This is very surprising as I thought it would have maybe steadily decreased. But no, even going
												back to 1990, the usage of coal was little to practically none.
											</li>
											<li>
												If we look at the changes in the usage of wind from 1990 to 2019, there is a huge one! 
												In 1990, there were only a couple states that used it (5 to be exact). But now in 2019,
												it seems like approximately 3/4s of the country takes advantage of it! Even if it may be in 
												its infancy stages, it is nice to see different sources being taken advantage of.
											</li>
										</ul>
